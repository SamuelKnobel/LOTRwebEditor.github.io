to generate this I followed a mixture of
- https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages
- https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/

What was missing was the follwoing:
- I deleted the .git folder that came with the react app and replaced it with a clone from this github repo
- I needed to do a first commit to the normal repo to instantiate it, otherwise it was empty and could not be found
- -
